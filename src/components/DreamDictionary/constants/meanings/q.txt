A queue is a line of people Waiting for their turn e.g. to

enter a cinema, get on a bus, to buy or given something. A -
queue. occurs virtually in any area where bottleneck

occurs. A queue is fermed when the rate 'of arrival of items

or persons requiring service is greater than the rate of
service. Thus it isan aggregation of items awaiting a service

function. ' ' H ' i

queue when details of actions and circumstances are taken
into consideration. Experience of individuals and position
in the queue matters a lot before answer'can be arrived at.

of arrival of items or persons requiring attention or service.

his or her turn. Thus, if things (good or bad) are shared
