Yams are edible tubers grown mostly in tropical regions.
They are kinds of tropical climbing plants. Yarn tubers are
round, short or long nature roots. The seeds are planted
by rst slicing them to sizes and bury them in the soil. It
does well in loamy soil. Planted seeds (sliced tubers)
germinate into full size of a tuber, after a period of eight or
ten months. Long sticks are sunk into the ground beside
it, to support the leaves' grow. The leaves are green at
initial stage but turn brown at maturity. Brown leaves are
signals of maturity for harvest. It is often wise to leave
yams uncultivated until the leaves dry on the stem, if it is
meant for storage. This will make it strong and mature,
Yams don't do well in/ water—logged soil, else it becomes

In this dream many still look fresh but were chained down.
I believe these sets of people are probably new capt1ves
in the den of wicked camp. Really, some were young while
some were old personalities. It comprised both sexes. This
was the situation in my dream.

As they saw me, they all rose as one man begging me to
lose and release them. In the dream, with angerl answered
"Leave me alone am I a police of cer or a soldier that will
release you" Then I woke. By then, I do not know the
importance of dream, let alone its meaning. So, when we
gathered at 3 AM midnight. for prayers, as usual we were
asked of dreams we dreamt. This was the procedure so
that we might know areas to address in prayers.
