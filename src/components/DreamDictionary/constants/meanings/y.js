The seeds are planted by first slicing them to sizes and bury them in the soil. It does well in loamy soil. Planted seeds (sliced tubers) germinate into full size of a tuber, after a period of eight or ten months. Long sticks are sunk into the ground beside it, to support the leaves' grow. The leaves are green at initial stage but turn brown at maturity. Brown leaves are signals of maturity for harvest. It is often wise to leave yams uncultivated until the leaves dry on the stem, if it is meant for storage. This will make it strong and mature. Yams don't do well in water-logged soil, else it becomes bad and rotten. The seeds are often white in color after peeling; few species have yellow colour as well. Yam tubers are either eaten cooked or roasted. Rodents and other related animals in the bush are its greatest enemies, as they eat the seeds raw.
